1) define what is a prototype ? syntax? --> explain by an example

Prototypes are created using object constructor

Ex:

fucntion Person(name, age, height weight){

	this.name = name;
	this.age = age;
	this.height = height;
	this.weight = weight;
}

now we create a new person object:

var me = new Person("harsha",23,6,0);

2) what is the difference when you add property to prototype vs when you add property using this? which is better?

When you add a property to a prototype, all the objects will inherit the same property.
Using this, we can let the developer enter his own field for the property.

So if all the objects are bound to have the same property, we use prototype, but is we want the user to input his own value, then this would be better.

3) use of this keyword? 

this will refer to the current object.

4) call apply and bind methods in java script

bind() method attaches the fucntion to the element.
call() will call the current fucntion with its set of arguments.
apply() unlike call apply takes all the arugments of a function in the form of an array.
