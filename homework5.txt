SELECTORS :: 
             

            these are used to targeting the page content

            class selectors -- use class attribute -- we can have multiple classes
                                
                                .aside{...}
                               <aside class = "aside1" > .. </aside>

            id selectors -- use id attribute -- id must be unique

                                #aside{..}
                                <aside id="aside">

            element specific selectors --    eg-  h2.artist{...}
                                                  <h2 class = "artist"></h2>

             universal selector -- applies to everything

                                     *{
                                      color: red;
                                     }

              grouping selectors --   we can group the selectors if we want to apply same style to different elements

                                       aside,article,section,header{

                                       }

              descendent selectors --  eg::  header h1{..}
                                             article h2{..}


              child selector ::  descendent selectors applies to all descendents of that parent elemnt

                                  child selector applies only to direct children of the parent.

                                  eg: article>h2{..}


               adjacent selector :  allow us to target elements based on which elemnts follow one another in the code

                                      h2+p{   ---> target the <p> that comes immediately after h2.

                                      }


               attribute selectors :  allow us to target elements based on the elements attributes and values of those attributes.

                                       eg :  a[title] {...}

                                       apply based on value of attribute -- a[title ="home"]

                                       a[title ~="red"]{} -- go ahead and look for whitespace seperated list that includes this word.
