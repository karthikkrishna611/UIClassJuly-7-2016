1) Implement an example for forEach and map, understand when to you which method of the arrays?

forEach calls for a method, once for each elemtn in a array.

   array.forEach(function(currentValue,index,arr), thisValue)

map creates a new array with the specified operation 

	array.map(function(currentValue,index,arr), thisValue)

2) Looks into the objects related methods hasOwnProperty, Obect.keys, 
	add a property, remove a property, modify a property


hasOwnProperty
	this specifies whether the object has the property mentioned.

object.keys()

	returns an array of an objects own enumerable properties.

Adding properties:

objectname.propertyname = propertyvalue;

Delete properties:

delete objectname.propertyname

3) different ways of creating objects

Using an Object Literal:

 var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"}; 

Using the JavaScript Keyword new:

var person = new Object();
person.firstName = "John";
person.lastName = "Doe";
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = "blue"; 

Using an Object Constructor
function person(first, last, age, eye) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eye;
}
var myFather = new person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
var myMother = new person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

4) what is prototype in java script?
Every JavaScript object has a prototype. The prototype is also an object.
All JavaScript objects inherit their properties and methods from their prototype.

function Person(first, last, age, eyecolor) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eyecolor;
}
