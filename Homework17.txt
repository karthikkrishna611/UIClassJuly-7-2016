1) look into java script hoisting, explain with an example? 

HOisting is javascript's behavior of moving the declarations to the top.x = 5; // Assign 5 to x

elem = document.getElementById("demo"); 
elem.innerHTML = x;                     

var x; 

Here the var x part is taken to the top. But initialised elements are not hoisted.
