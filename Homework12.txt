1) differences between while, do while and for loop

while loop :


while ( condition ) {
}

do while :

do{
}
while( condition ) 

checks for condition after the iteration is done

for loop:

for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
}

can initialize, give condition and perform increment in the loop itself.


2) switch case statement.

switch(variable)
{

case 1: //statement
break;

case 2: //statement
break;
.
.
.

default: //statement
break;
}
