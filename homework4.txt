1) difference between display: none and visibility : hidden ?

      ---> dispaly : none -- it doesnot occupy any space in the page and element will not be displayed

      ---> visibility : hiddem -- it occupies space in the page but element will not be displayed

2) display property values , inline , inline-block , block ?

         inline -- they donot begin with new line

         inline-block -- this also doesn't begin in new line but we can specify the width and height.

         block --  line break before and after the element and we can specify width and height.


 3) inline css , internal css , external css ?

          inline css -- this is applied for the particular element for which we specify the styles

          internal css -- this styles are applied for the whole page --> these styles are provided in the <style> </style> tags in the head section of the document

          external css -- this is the external source where we write the styles and link it to the pages we need the styles to be applied.


      which style is considered the important is depends --> to build a website with multiple pages it's better to consider external css.


  4) css specificity -->  Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be 

  applied. Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of CSS selectors of different sorts.

                   ---> increasing specificity ---      Type selectors (e.g., h1) and pseudo-elements (e.g., :before).

														Class selectors (e.g., .example), attributes selectors (e.g., [type="radio"]) and pseudo-classes (e.g., :hover).

														ID selectors (e.g., #example).


							!important ---> when this is applied to  a style declaration then it overrides any other declarations.
